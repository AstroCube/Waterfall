 ==========
 Layer 7 proxy designed to link Minecraft servers.
 --------------------------------------------------
 
 BungeeCord is a sophisticated proxy and API designed mainly to teleport players between multiple Minecraft servers. It is the latest incarnation of similar software written by the author from 2011-present.
 
+_Note that this version includes Guice modules at every Plugin that you can use in `configure() {}`. Waterfall will inject them dynamically._
